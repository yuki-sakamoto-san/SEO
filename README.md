### SERP Scraper 
Use the SERP Scraper to extract the top 10 search results and analyze each page's common sections. This framework will help you develop an SEO-focused content brief.

Note: You will need to manually input each URL from the search results.

### SERP Analyzer 
Use the SERP analyzer to determine whether a query you're looking to search is informational, navigational, or commercial. It also scrapes the top 10 headings, suggests recommended keywords, identifies SERP feature opportunities such as featured snippets and knowledge panels, and analyzes if you have any image SEO or video opportunities.

<h3>BERT.py</h3>

BERT.py is a framework generated by Gofish Digital and it helps you analyze how close your text value are to one another. The closer they are, the more similar the content is and the more relevant it's preceived to be. Search engines like Google use similiarity to understand if a given page is a close enough match for given query. Once you run this script, the Python Script will take the generated embeddings for the sentence and keyword and output a "Similiarty Score". 

This will be a score from **0 to 1** on how relevant the text is to the query that you entered. 

This framework allows us to understand how relevant our content is to a given query.
